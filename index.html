                    chilling time, etc. Just a simple, straightforward, amazingly delicious, doughy yet still fully
                    cooked, chocolate chip cookie that turns out perfectly every single time!

                <h2>Brownies</h2>
                <div class="details">These brownies are super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly
                    tops. The recipe calls for basic pantry ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a
                    mix. As for the brownies, they’re true perfection – glossy, fudgy, and filled with rich chocolate
                    flavor.</div>
